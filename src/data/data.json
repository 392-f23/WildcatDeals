    "description": "Orangetheory Fitness is a one-hour full-body workout, consisting of mixed-impact interval training. Classes are comprised of half endurance and half strength and power training. We switch across those training methods throughout the class to challenge the body, utilizing treadmills, water rowers, and strength training equipment. Everyone in the class wears a heart rate monitor; students' heart rate information is subsequently shown in real time on large screens in our studio space. The personal trainer guides the class through five heart rate zones to ensure no one over-trains nor under-trains. Our goal is for clients to work at 84% or greater of their max heart rates for 12-20 minutes of their classes. This amount of exertion creates calories burn post class for up to 36 hours! Backed by the science of excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC), our heart-rate monitored training is designed to keep heart rates in a target zone that stimulates metabolism and increases energy over time. Here are quick videos showing what we do:What to Expect at Your First Orangetheory Fitness ClassA Special Safety Message From Our Chief Brand Officer",
